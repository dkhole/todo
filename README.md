# todo

-   Have to fix close card/open card event loader bug.
-   Have to remove ability to click other options whilst in delete mode
-   Set limit to todo title and notes or use overflow '...'
-   Same with cards title 
-   Need to add logo with link to git
-   Need to add lightmode

Overall happy with how it turned out but feel like the code got a little too complex towards the end. Adding and removing event listeners and managing their states with different renders is probably not the best way to go. Need to look up better ways to structure code and manage events. 
Started off clean, had appropriate factory functions and module for the main board. Split the render functions and event functions well but i think i let those files get too big and i too often had to refractor functions. Have to more preemptiveley split everything into a function.
Have spent more than a week on this as someone helped with designing the todo which had me feeling more commited. Really want to move on to react, so will come back to thie project soon
